# Sudoku-Generator
<i>Sudoku Generator</i> is a creates sudokus in five different difficulty levels. Those are:
<b>
  - Extremly Easy
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Hard
  - Devil's Playground</b> (you would be the first to solve one of those I know)
 
The GUI also gives access to internal features used while generating the sudoku. So is it possible to solve any sudoku, get the number of unique sudokus that could be generated with the input (A correctly solvable sudoku has just one solution) and create random terminal patterns. 

The GUI is also easy to use and it is very simple to type in generators into the given sudoku field. The from the creator recommended way is a simple type-in and change focus with tab. This will circle through all fields.
The GUI also finds live during type-in errors in the sudoku and will mark any rule breaking numbers red. This behaviour support the type in of any sudoku.

The generated sudoku (with any method) can saved as either a TXT file, or a full vector PDF.
